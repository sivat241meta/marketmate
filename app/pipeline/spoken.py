"""Seller's-words names: deterministic post-extraction renaming (Task 139).

The model's item names vary run to run, so after extraction each draft
item's names are re-derived from its own spoken span (the transcript
words behind "Play what you said", kept in ``proof.quote``):

* :func:`spoken_item_name` takes the words before the first
  quantity/unit/price token, stripping number words, units, currency,
  repeated words and punctuation.
* :func:`apply_spoken_name` compares that spoken name with the model's
  names. A spoken qualifier the model dropped (புது, சின்ன, sweet, ...),
  a spoken name for a different known item (கிறன் ஃப்ரூட் is muskmelon),
  or a garbled model name (செவ்வாழ வாழை) is replaced with the seller's
  own words; the variety becomes the English qualifier and the English
  name its base, so titles read "new potato" via the Task 136 helpers.
  A canonical model name for the same item is kept, and a missing span
  keeps the model's names. When the model name is itself a known item
  for something else (banana claimed, poosani heard), nothing is
  renamed: the blocking NAME_NOT_NEAR_PRICE check flags it instead.
  Prices are never touched.
